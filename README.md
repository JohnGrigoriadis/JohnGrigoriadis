# Hello, I'm Giannis! 👋

I'm an AI Engineer with a minor in Data Science dedicated to developing intelligent systems that drive innovation and efficiency. My expertise spans machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, with a focus on creating scalable AI solutions.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools

- **Programming Languages:** Python 
- **Machine Learning Frameworks:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, TensorFlow

## 🛠️ Projects

### [Learning generalist behaviour for traversing different terrains]([link-to-project-repo](https://github.com/JohnGrigoriadis/generalist-controllers-terrain))

The paper addresses the limited understanding of robustness and generalisability in neuro-evolutionary methods, specifically focusing on artificial neural networks (ANNs) used in control tasks, such as those applied in robotics. In the paper, we test the generalisation ability of BipedalWalker controllers when traversing multiple different terrains.

### [Minesweeper]([link-to-project-repo](https://github.com/JohnGrigoriadis/MineSweeper))

I wanted to challenge myself to make the classic Windows game Minesweeper in Python all by myself without any help: some documentation, no ChagGPT or Copilot. Turned out better than I expected for only a few hours of work.
